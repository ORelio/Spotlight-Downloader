=======================================================

Thanks for dowloading SpotlightDL!

This program can retrieve Windows Spotlight images by requesting the Microsoft Spotlight API.
SpotlightDL can also define images as wallpaper and system-wide lockscreen image.

It is useful in the following use cases:
 - Download the whole Spotlight library with maximum image resolution and metadata
 - Define Spotlight images as wallpaper, not only on Windows 11 but also on previous versions
 - Define Spotlight images as global lock screen on Windows 7/8/10/11, without ads on Windows 10/11
 - Chain SpotlightDL with your own scripts and apps by taking advantage of the url mode

============
 How to use
============

Extract the archive if not already extracted, then call SpotlightDownloader.exe from the command line.
If you are not used to the command prompt, a few Batch files are offered for your convenience:

spotlight-download-archive
  This script downloads as much images as possible from the Spotlight API,
  with maximum res and metadata. Please note that there is no actual way
  of listing *all* images so SpotlightDownloader will make many API calls
  to discover and download new images, and stop when no new images are
  discovered. It may miss a few images but you should get most of them.

update-archive-and-wallpaper
  This script calls once the Spotlight API and adds the result to the
  Spotlight archive, then randomly defines a Spotlight image as wallpaper
  This allows to gradually download images without hammering the Spotlight API.

update-archive-and-lockscreen
  Same as update-archive-and-wallpaper but updates the system-wide lockscreen.
  This script must be run as administrator as it replaces an image in the
  Windows folder and clear the lockscreen cache to force a lockscreen refresh.

update-wallpaper
  This script maintains a cache of several Spotlight pictures tailored to your screen
  resolution and randomly defines a new Spotlight image as wallpaper. The cache allows
  a few updates without Internet access, and oldest images are deleted from the cache.

update-lockscreen
  Same as update-wallpaper but defines images as system-wide lockscreen
  This script must be run as administrator as it replaces an image in the
  Windows folder and clear the lockscreen cache to force a lockscreen refresh.

restore-lockscreen
  This script restores the default lockscreen image.
  This script must be run as administrator.

generate-manual
  This script saves usage info as a text file for your convenience,
  in order to help writing your own batch files or PowerShell scripts.

hide-console
  This script launches another script without showing the console window.
  Mostly useful if you plan to schedule an update script on logon.
  The path passed as argument should not contain special characters.

===========================
 Scheduling a batch script
===========================

If you wish to periodically update your wallpaper or lockscreen,
you can schedule one of the provided scripts by following these instructions:

= If you are not administrator =
= Startup shortcut method =

Use Win+R keyboard shortcut and specify:
  %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

Perform a right click inside the Startup folder > New > Shortcut
  wscript "C:\Path\To\hide-console.vbs" "C:\Path\To\desired-script.bat"
  Next > Type a meaningful name for that shortcut > Finish

The shortcut will launch on each logon and run the script.
Note: lockscreen-related scripts won't work with this method.

= If you are administrator =
= Task scheduler method =

Use Win+R and specify:
  taskschd.msc

Click "Create a new task"
  General tab
    - Define the task name
    - Check "Run with highest privileges" to run the script as admin (lockscreen...)
  Triggers tab
    - Click New and add a trigger: "At log on" or "On a schedule" for instance
  Actions tab
    - Click New, choose Start a program
    - Program/Script: wscript
    - Add arguments: "C:\Path\To\hide-console.vbs" "C:\Path\To\desired-script.bat"
  Conditions tab
    - You may want to uncheck "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power"
  Settings tab
    - If your task has a defined schedule, e.g. everyday at 10am but your computer
      is powered off at 10am, the task will not run. You may want to enable the
      "Run task as soon as possible after a sheduled start is missed" feature.

Click OK to save your task.
